When payments are missed, you’re stuck chasing them and manually overlocking storage units, wasting time and losing revenue.

There’s a better way...

Gavin in his first self storage facility
It’s easy to switch.
Using another self storage software already? We know that switching can be daunting, that’s why our team is with you every step of the way.

“We switched many sites and just short of 1,000 customers all with existing payment details and smart entry codes to Stora. Their team did a lot of the heavy lifting and supported us throughout the entire process.

It went incredibly smoothly, all invoices and payments came across without any problems, and all smart entry codes were imported across perfectly.”

"If the customer has a problem with payment, I just love how seamless it all is in Stora. I don't have to do anything. It all happens automatically. I wake up, read my Stora emails to see who's been locked out today, wait until 9 a.m., and usually by then the tenant’s made the payment and it's all good."

Choosing Self Storage Management Software: What To Ask
By Gavin Shields on October 22, 2022
choose-software-cover.jpg
Discover the key questions every operator should ask vendors when choosing self storage management software, and why.
Whether you’re starting out or looking to modernize, choosing the wrong software to run your self storage business can be an incredibly costly mistake. The difference between the right and wrong decision is the difference between an efficient business set for success and one that is expensive to run, slow to adapt, and likely to struggle.

Before making a decision, it is vitally important to understand the difference between modern solutions and older products on the market.

Traditional Self Storage Software Focus
When operators start looking for self storage software, they usually begin by looking for something that helps them manage their facility. Things like allocating units, tracking availability and even generating customer invoices. Anything that helps manage the facility and the day-to-day tasks associated with running it. Almost all the existing self storage software products, many of which have been around for over 20 years, do this.

But the world has changed since then. Self storage software is no longer about just tracking unit availability and creating invoices. It should reach right across your entire business, helping you market, sell, maximize revenue and reduce effort.

How to pick the right self storage software?
Here are eight key questions you should ask vendors when choosing self storage management software, and why they matter. They’ll help you compare solutions more knowledgeably and ensure that you pick a modern solution that can help you build and run an efficient business, grow, and meet the challenges of the future.

How does it help me find customers?

How does it help me sell to customers?

How does it help me automate my business?

How can it help me automatically grow sales over time?

Does it help me minimize risks to the business?

Is the product developing with the future in mind?

How many versions of your product are you building and maintaining?

Can I try before I buy?

Modern Self Storage Software Capabilities
View full screen

How does it help me find customers?
😴 Traditional software will struggle to answer this question. Traditional vendors expect you to have a standalone website—one built using a basic consumer tool like Wordpress or Wix—and once your site has done the work to generate a lead, that's when their management solution becomes relevant to track and progress the sale.

However, while using these DIY website builders can be great for hobbies and pet projects, for a business they aren't always the bargain they seem:

Firstly, they need to appeal to a vast range of users, so template designs, layouts and functionality are generic, rather than created specifically for the needs of a self storage business. They’re also often limited in features.

Customizing templates to get your site to do what your business needs it to will almost always require upfront and repeated help from specialists (in other words: upfront costs and ongoing costs!).

And when you don't have expertise in web design and performance and have a go without professional help, it’s surprisingly easy to accidentally make choices and additions that will make your website incredibly slow (which hurts your site’s search ranking) or screws up the user experience (UX) (which affects conversions). Not only that, building a site this way will take you longer than you think and likely end up costing you more than you expect (up-front as well as the ongoing cost and effort of keeping it working as browsers and operating systems are updated, integrations unexpectedly disconnect, etc).

Want to include ecommerce capabilities too? That'll triple the complexity you have to manage.

🤩 Modern software understands that in today’s market, it’s no longer good enough to create software that just manages the facility. With most self storage customers now beginning their search for your product online, the right software will play a crucial role in customers finding you in the first place.

Website speed comparisons: typical Stora site vs industry leaders
Website speed test scores: typical Stora site vs industry leaders
A modern piece of self storage management software will come with a super-fast loading website that Google will a) love and, b) in return, show your website higher up the results. This means you get customers to your site before they end up on a competitor's site, which means more lead generation than your competitors, more sales, more profits, and a more successful business.

It will be mapped out specifically to prioritize the key content self storage customers need to see in order to make a purchase decision. And it will be optimized for turning visitors into customers. In short, all of the specialist web performance, UX, and functionality will be already baked in—strategically designed for the needs of self storage operators and customers—so all you need to do is add text and images.

Average conversion rates in self storage
How does it help me sell to customers?
😴 Traditional software will answer this with a big emphasis on its Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. A CRM system is designed to help teams efficiently follow up on leads by letting them assign a salesperson, add notes to a lead, set alerts and reminders, etc. And this feature remains an important part of these older solutions because their clients are still carrying out sales manually.

🤩 Modern software knows there’s no better way to convert a website lead into a customer than making it really easy for them to book and pay online right there and then. So it will offer self-service customer experiences by default, where visitors can book storage and add their recurring digital payment method themselves (credit card, direct debit, etc). If these sales experiences are professionally designed and optimized, the conversion rate from website visitor to paying customer should be high. If your vendor offers an integrated website process, you should ask for data showing their conversion rates. (For example, operators using Stora’s self storage software average over 3% conversion compared to an industry average lead conversion rate of just 1.5%.)

BUYER BEWARE!
Watch out for online booking and payment flows that ignore best practices for online conversions. Erecting barriers before you get the customer past the first big conversion event—entering payment details—will decimate conversion rates and lead to lower sales and higher staff costs. For example, a booking flow that asks customers to upload ID and sign contracts before adding payment details will kill conversions.
As the occasional visitor may have questions, a modern platform will also include live chat (either built in or via integration) so you can answer questions in real time from your phone while that lead is still on your website and in the buying mindset. And while a modern solution will include CRM features, these will be heavily automated so the software is doing the heavy lifting (eg, customer emails and texts, staff reminders).

How does it help me automate my business?
😴 Traditional software will offer basic automations to reduce administrative effort around a few repetitive tasks. These are mainly as follows, and if the self storage software you're investigating doesn’t do these things, you should immediately look elsewhere:

the creation and sending of invoices to customers;

connecting to a payment processor to process payments on your behalf; and

connecting to smart entry systems that allow your customers to get codes for their unit’s door.

However, be sure to probe with your salesperson whether these tasks are truly automatic, or whether they require initiation first. In older software, often you must log in and click buttons in order to kick off ‘automated’ processes, and you may need to do this multiple times each day depending on the platform, the size of your facility, and the volume of sales and billing activity you’re generating. This can be a surprising time drain on your staff and adds delays for your customers.

🤩 Modern software will automate all of the above plus much more, but in a truly hands-free way. Here are some of the most impactful time-savers you should expect to see in a state-of-the-art solution:

PAYMENT COLLECTION
It will automate the collection of payments using pull payment methods (as opposed to leaving it to customers to send money to you manually each time).

RECONCILIATIONS
It will automatically reconcile the payment against the invoice.

MISSED PAYMENTS
When a payment fails, it will automatically retry the payment repeatedly over a set period (for example, eight times over two weeks) so you almost never need to get involved in chasing missed payments. It can also automatically collect and update expired customer card details so missed payments don’t happen in the first place. Combined, these two features can dramatically reduce the debtors in your client base. (For example, the average operator using Stora’s self storage software has up to 6x fewer debtors than the industry average—resulting in a 2%–3% sales boost.)

DATA ENTRY
It will connect the website’s bookings and payments system directly to the management software so that customer contact and payment details are automatically synced and staff don’t have to manually re-enter them.

UNIT ALLOCATION
It will let you set rules that control how the software automatically allocates units, opening up the possibility of customers booking, paying, passing ID checks, signing a contract, and moving in without any effort from you or any of your staff.

At Stora, we plan to release a feature that lets your customers get from your front gate to move in within 90 seconds. Traditional self storage software can’t even dream of innovating like this, because they only solve a very narrow piece of the end-to-end process.

ACCOUNTING AUTOMATION
It will automate your accounting by running reconciliations and creating the necessary accounting entries for you (rather than you spending hours each week manually copying invoices into your accounting platform). As a benchmark, operators using Stora finish their accounting in less than 30 minutes/month.

SMART PRICING
It can automatically raise or lower your prices based on remaining availability in your facility or in line with supply and demand in your area.

SALES FOLLOW-UPS
It can automate reminders and sweeteners to leads who haven’t completed their booking yet.

MOVE OUT MANAGEMENT
It can automated the move-out process, including notifying you when the unit has been left empty and cleaned.

It’s true that some of the older software products can work alongside third-party web booking systems. But, these are separate products that aren’t integrated, and they vary hugely in quality. While using these solutions side by side can solve some issues and make it easier to transact online, the experience, flexibility and power of these combos can never match a software product where the website, ecommerce, facility management, and pricing have been designed together from the ground up.

How can it help me automatically grow sales over time?
😴 Traditional software doesn’t typically get involved in the direct to customer sales process and, though some facilitate passing price increases on to existing customers, these processes tend to be very time consuming and require you to deal with customer contacts.

More importantly, traditional self storage software charges on a per-unit basis. This sounds appealing on the surface—predictable costs. But look closer and the picture is a lot less rosy. It means they have no incentive to help you grow sales, as they’ll get paid regardless of what happens to your sales—even if your units are sitting empty.

🤩 Modern software will be much more focused on helping you grow sales over time, and this will be obvious from their pricing structure—usually charging you a variable percentage revenue fee so that their success is tightly connected to your success and their business grows only when your business grows. This is how we do it at Stora, and this model is what keeps modern providers like us laser focused on planning, prioritizing, designing, and releasing new functionality that helps you to grow.

In addition to the some of the automations mentioned in the section above, some features to look out for include:

automated price increases for existing customers;

travel-style upselling at checkout (eg. pay extra for a unit near the front door, upgrade your insurance); and

the ability to charge customers extra for additional contract flexibility.

Does it help me minimize risks to the business?
😴 Traditional software may digitize and store your team’s risk management evidence, but it won’t proactively help you prevent risk. For example, to protect themselves, operators need to verify who the customer is and ensure they agree to the facility’s T&Cs. Older software expects facilities to ask every customer to bring ID documents into the office where staff photocopy them, and to appear in person to sign contracts (which is, incidentally, extremely time-consuming for both staff and customers). The platform may offer document scanning and uploading to your tenant’s profile in the CRM, but it doesn’t solve the risk of human error in the manual verification and contracting process, nor does it help you with the fact that those originals are often stored physically on site—which can go against data protection regulations and are a data breach waiting to happen.

🤩 Modern software will provide automated digital ID checks that do bank-level verifications and also facial recognition checks (making sure customers can’t possibly use stolen IDs). In addition, the latest software will offer digital contracting where customers sign an online contract in seconds, the platform immediately notifies you, and the docs are instantly filed in the system without you lifting a finger.

Is the product developing with the future in mind?
😴 Traditional software tends to release new functionality once a year or every six months. Even then, those products are often heavily focused around processes that are outdated and no longer represent the best way to operate a modern business.

Avoid software designed around outdated processes, like this early train built to simply pull old carts previously pulled by horses.
Avoid software designed around outdated processes, like this early train built to simply pull old carts previously pulled by horses.
🤩 Modern software will be very focused on where the industry is going and will be designing and developing features that help your business adjust to the ever changing competitive landscape. It’s not always about where a specific software product is today, but where it is going.

What is the vision for the product? Where do they see the industry going? Do you share that vision? Can they deliver on that vision with their existing team and/or financing? Will they still be in business in one or two years?

At Stora, we release features and improvements every few weeks. Platforms like ours are constantly building and releasing automation tools that help you run a more efficient business, and they’ll be able to show you their roadmap of what’s coming soon as well as their Changelog of what’s gone live over the past quarter, year, etc, as proof of their innovation velocity.

How many versions of your product are you building and maintaining?
😴 Traditional software often has multiple branches of its product, where different customizations are created in different versions for different customers (for a fee). It’s an important question because maintaining this portfolio of similar, but slightly different, versions of their product behind the scenes makes it prohibitively expensive and slow to build regular feature updates for everyone else. This can lead to a relatively stagnant product with little innovation, and over time you’ll find yourself stuck with a set of features that won’t change unless you’re prepared to pay extra for your own customizations.

Vendors won’t always be upfront about this style of product development, and it can be difficult to tell from appearances. But one way to spot this sort of software is to look at how regularly it releases updates. Annual or twice-yearly updates are usually a telltale sign.

🤩 Modern software is developed as a single core product that, as features and improvements are made, are instantly available to all customers. And because the developers and designers are only ever building and maintaining one version of the product, they have more bandwidth for continuous improvement. Not only do you get the features you liked when you signed up, but you get access to tons of new features forever into the future that instantly appear in your account—inspired by feedback, requests, and operator best practices from around the world—giving you benefits and features you might not have known to ask for.

Can I try it before I buy?
😴 Traditional software can feel noticeably dated. Sometimes it only runs on PC desktop computers (tough luck Apple lovers). Sometimes it’s not cloud-based, meaning you can only access it from one machine in one location (so long remote working). And because it’s been designed over decades, visual elements and interactions can feel disjointed and confusing compared to how we expect software to work in this age of tap and swipe—making them difficult to use.

🤩 Modern software will load fast, save fast, be accessible on any make of internet-connected device, and have modern design and controls that are as high quality as the products you love and use every day, like Uber, Netflix and Spotify. Not only are they a pleasure to use, but they’re also much easier to train staff on because they’re designed to be intuitive. And it’s usually easy to get set up with a free trial to play around.

Wrapping up
We know that choosing self storage management software can be really difficult—navigating and assessing a range of vendors, feature sets, and benefits. But, there is a huge difference between many of the older products that are focused on facility management and modern products.

There are three main advantages to modern self storage software worth remembering:

They start working when your customer's journey begins, from helping them find your website to maximizing online conversion and everything from then on.

They automate core repetitive tasks, saving time, saving money and growing sales on autopilot.

They develop one core product for the benefit of all customers, not separate products, custom add ons, or features that only benefit the one customer who has paid for it.

A Complete Guide To Self Storage Facility Management
By Jenna Wimshurst on December 31, 2024
Self-storage-facility-management.jpg
There are over 50,000 self storage facilities in the U.S. and over 3,000 in the UK. If you’re planning on investing in your own business, you’re up against some stiff competition.

However, if you manage your self storage business well, you have a good chance of beating the competition and making a substantial profit.

Some self storage owners prefer to use a management company to run their business, but we recommend starting with the basics yourself.

In this article, we’ll cover everything you need to know about managing your own self storage facility to see success and drive revenue.

What Is Storage Facility Management?

Source: Freepik

Storage facility management is the day-to-day operations and strategic oversight of a facility to ensure its efficiency, profitability, and customer satisfaction.

It involves handling all the aspects of the facility, from customer interactions to maintenance, security, and financial management.

Effective storage facility management requires organization, technical knowledge, and customer service skills to meet the needs of both your business and customers.

Sales and Marketing

Source: Freepik

Sales and marketing are critical to the success of self storage facilities because they drive occupancy rates, generate revenue, and help your business stand out in a competitive market.

The average occupancy of storage facilities in Europe is 78.7%. To generate consistent success, you need to maintain high occupancy levels. Effective sales and marketing strategies attract new customers and retain existing ones, ensuring your self storage units remain rented.

The key element of marketing your self storage company is driving potential customers to your website to learn about your offering and book their storage units.

Let’s look at three marketing tactics you can use to drive traffic to your website and get more bookings:

➡️ Pay-per-click (PPC) ads
You can use advertising platforms like Facebook ads or Google Ads to target local customers searching for self storage facilities. This type of marketing is called PPC advertising, and it can help you reach a highly specific audience.

The average return on investment (ROI) for PPC is 200%, making it a good investment for your business.

➡️ Social media advertising
Almost 60% of social media users check their profiles daily. Leverage social media to promote your self storage facility by creating engaging posts to showcase your services, customer reviews, and discounts or promotions you’re running.

➡️ Search engine optimization (SEO)
Search engine optimization refers to optimizing your website to ensure people can find it when they use search engines to look for something.

More than 68% of online experiences begin with a search engine, so you must ensure your site is visible in search results.

Optimizing your website may improve its ranking in search engine results pages (SERPs), increasing the chances of local customers finding it and opting for your services.

➡️ Customer relationship management (CRM) platforms
Previously, self storage facilities had to use cold calling and similar tactics to attract new customers. However, much of the sales and marketing process can now be automated and handled remotely through your website alongside a CRM.

Most businesses see their sales and revenue increase by 21% to 30% after implementing a CRM platform.

Using a CRM like Hubspot means you can:

👉 Capture leads when people visit your self storage facility’s website.

👉 Store these leads and track them.

👉 Send automated emails to follow up with customers and share more details about your facility.

👉 Send discounts to people who haven’t yet rented a unit.

Taking Bookings

Source: Freepik

How you set up your bookings platform will directly impact customer convenience, operational efficiency, and revenue generation.

The booking process can determine whether a potential customer chooses your facility or a competitor’s.

Customers will prefer facilities with a seamless booking process, especially when they are in a hurry to rent a self storage unit.

An intuitive online booking system ensures customers can check availability, compare unit sizes and prices, and reserve a unit without hassle. This also means they don’t have to visit your facility in person to make a booking.

A booking system integrated with your website can help you manage reservations, keep track of available units, and give you a clear view of your occupancy rates.

With the right software, you can connect your booking system to the locking mechanism on your self storage units. This means customers don’t have to visit your site to collect keys. Instead, a code is sent to their mobile phones that allows them to open their units themselves.

Website Management

Source: Freepik

A good website is essential for self storage facilities because it acts as a digital storefront, often making the first impression on potential customers.

Just as a well-maintained physical storefront attracts walk-in customers, a professional and user-friendly website draws online visitors and converts them into paying customers.

Beyond conversions, your website is also the ideal place for customers to make bookings and manage their storage services. It makes things convenient for them and provides an excellent customer experience.

Websites that are well-managed and perform well can achieve conversion rates above 10%.

Below are some of the ways you can manage your storage facility website to drive conversions and convenience:

💻 Plan downtime at a convenient time
Website downtime for maintenance or updates is sometimes necessary, but planning it during periods of low traffic, like midnight or weekends, ensures minimal disruption for customers trying to make bookings or access information.

💻 Install updates and patches
Updates and security patches are essential to protecting your website from vulnerabilities. Hackers often target outdated systems, so timely updates safeguard sensitive customer information, such as payment details and personal data.

Many updates include performance enhancements, bug fixes, and improved functionality, ensuring your site runs smoothly and offers an optimal user experience.

💻 Ensure your information and pricing are up to date
Accurate pricing and unit availability builds trust and reduces customer frustration. Outdated or incorrect information, such as showing unavailable units as available, can lead to a negative perception of your facility and even lost business.

💻 Keep your content updated
Search engines favor websites that consistently update and refresh their content. Regularly updating blog posts, FAQs, and your service pages helps maintain or improve your rankings in search results.

Updating blog posts and other older content can increase your traffic by nearly 96%.

Additionally, regularly adding helpful content to your website, such as storage tips, moving guides, or seasonal advice, can attract and retain customers.

⭐️ Get the Ideal Self Storage Website with Stora

Stora is an all-in-one self storage management tool that offers comprehensive website design services. Our websites are expertly designed to generate leads, drive conversions, and rank well in SERPs.

Customer Onboarding

Source: Freepik

In the past, onboarding new customers meant self storage facility owners or their staff had to show them around the site. As mentioned earlier, it also meant that customers had to visit self storage properties to sign their leases and collect their keys.

Now, using the right automation software, customers can access their units via an app or a code. This can enhance operational efficiency and satisfy customers.

Another way to streamline onboarding your customers is to send them comprehensive videos and how-to guides on accessing and using their storage units so that you don’t have to walk them through this in person.

Servicing Customers

Source: Freepik

Customer service is the cornerstone of success for self storage facilities. Beyond offering secure and easily accessible units, facilities must prioritize exceptional customer service to build trust, foster loyalty, and maintain a competitive edge.

You need to ensure your staff can be easily contacted via phone, email, or online chat to help customers at a moment’s notice. This is known as omnichannel support, which can turn 89% of customers into loyal ones.

You should also provide up-to-date and clear contact information on your website and within your facility so that customers can reach you whenever they need to.

Additionally, you may want to consider maintaining a physical presence at your storage facility. Below are some pros and cons of doing so:

The pros of having a physical presence
✅ Personal interaction: In-person communication allows your storage manager or other staff to address customer inquiries, resolve issues, and provide a personal touch, fostering trust and loyalty.

✅ On-the-spot assistance: Staff can immediately assist with tasks such as explaining unit sizes, helping customers access their units, or troubleshooting issues like tech malfunctions.

✅ Enhanced security: A physical presence may discourage theft and vandalism as customers and potential intruders know staff are on-site.

The cons of having a physical presence
❌ Higher operational costs: Employing on-site staff adds to labor costs, particularly if coverage is required during extended hours.

❌ Facility expenses: Providing amenities for staff, such as office space, utilities, technology, and break areas, increases overhead expenses.

❌ Dependent on staff availability: If staff are unavailable due to illness, vacation, or turnover, customer service and operations may be disrupted.

Facility Maintenance

Maintenance can extend the lifespan of your facility’s assets by up to 33%. Storage facility maintenance is the ongoing tasks and processes required to ensure the property is safe, clean, functional, and aesthetically pleasing to your customers.

This includes both routine upkeep and addressing unexpected issues to maintain high standards of operation.

Maintenance tasks typically include:

General cleaning: Keeping units, hallways, and common areas clean and free of debris.
Repairs: Fixing damaged unit doors, locks, gates, lighting, or other equipment.
Pest control: Preventing and managing infestations to protect stored items.
Security system checks: Regularly testing surveillance cameras, alarm systems, and access control systems.
Facility inspections: Checking for structural issues, leaks, or signs of wear and tear.
Upkeep: Ensuring the facility looks appealing and well-maintained, both inside and out.
Chasing Late Payments

Source: Freepik

Over 55% of invoices issued in the U.S. are paid late. When customers don’t pay on time, it can become a big headache for storage facility managers. It also impacts your revenue and the amount of admin you have to do.

Using the right automation tools allows you to automatically overlock units when monthly rentals aren’t paid. This means that your customers can’t access their units until they make a payment.

This saves you time and resources and makes customers responsible for access to their units.

With Stora’s auto overlocking feature, your storage units will automatically be unlocked to reactivate access once a payment clears.

Security

Source: Freepik

Storage facility security is the measures and systems you put in place to protect your property, customers’ belongings, and the overall operation of your facility from theft, vandalism, and other security threats.

Effective security creates peace of mind for customers and ensures your self storage facility’s reputation and operational integrity are upheld.

So, what does storage facility security involve? Let’s unpack a few key aspects:

🔒 Regular maintenance of security equipment: All security systems, including surveillance cameras, access control systems, alarms, and lighting, must be regularly inspected and maintained to ensure proper functioning.

🔒 Proactive repairs: Faulty equipment, such as a broken gate keypad or malfunctioning camera, should be fixed immediately to avoid vulnerabilities.

🔒 Periodic testing: Conducting routine tests of alarms, locks, and access control systems ensures they respond as expected in emergencies.

🔒 Active surveillance: CCTV cameras should be strategically positioned to monitor critical areas, including entrances, exits, storage units, and communal spaces.

🔒 Remote monitoring: Advanced security systems allow staff or third-party security companies to monitor your facility remotely, ensuring it is always under watch, even during off-hours.

🔒 Timely response: When an alarm is triggered, or suspicious activity is detected, staff or your security personnel should respond quickly and assess the situation.

🔒 Emergency protocols: Clearly defined protocols for responding to break-ins, vandalism, or unauthorized access ensure quick and effective action.

Monitoring Performance

Regularly monitoring key performance metrics, such as occupancy rates and storage facility ROI, is crucial for the success and profitability of your business.

These metrics provide insights into your business’s financial health, operational efficiency, and market competitiveness.

Tracking occupancy rates helps identify seasonal patterns, periods of high demand, and underperforming times. For example, the most demanding time of year for self storage is May through September, the most common season in which people move into new homes.

This information allows you to adjust your pricing strategies—like discounts or dynamic pricing—to optimize revenue.

If your metrics reveal that your business isn’t performing well, you can adjust your strategy and make changes to ensure profitability.

Having the right self storage software in place and ensuring that as many of your systems are integrated with it as possible will help you measure your key business metrics.

A Quick Guide To Self Storage Revenue Management Optimization
By Gavin Shields on December 17, 2024
Revenue-management-blog_2024-12-11-123806_vnds.jpg
Did you know that 80% of companies fail to meet their cost-reduction targets, indicating potential shortcomings in revenue management practices?

If self storage operators don’t manage their revenue effectively, they could:

❌ Miss out on revenue opportunities.

❌ Increase operating costs.

❌ Reduce their competitive edge.

❌ Encounter cash flow problems.

❌ Experience long-term financial losses.

The self storage industry is highly competitive, so you could face disastrous consequences if you don’t optimize your business’s revenue.

As a self storage facility owner myself, I have learned much about how to manage and optimize your revenue to run a significantly profitable business.

In this article, I’ll unpack what revenue management is, how to optimize it, and the best revenue management system to help you build a profitable self storage business.

What Is Self Storage Revenue Management?

Self storage revenue management involves optimizing pricing, occupancy, and profitability for self storage facilities.

It uses data-driven techniques, market analysis, and technology to maximize revenue while balancing customer demand and operational efficiency.

The Four Key Components of Self Storage Revenue Management

Now that you know what revenue management is, let’s unpack the four key practices you should be aware of:

➡️ Dynamic pricing

Source: Freepik

This refers to modifying what you charge per storage unit in response to real-time factors such as:

👉 Demand.

👉 Unit availability.

👉 Seasonal trends.

👉 Your facility’s location.

You can use data analytics and technology to align your pricing with current market conditions. This approach ensures your pricing remains competitive while maintaining a balance between supply and demand.

For example, if your facility has high occupancy rates for a specific type of storage unit, you can increase prices for that size to capitalize on demand.

➡️ Demand forecasting

Source: Freepik

Demand forecasting involves predicting future customer demand for your storage units based on historical data, market trends, and external factors. It helps you anticipate and maintain high occupancy rates.

Let’s say it’s summer, and you own a storage facility near a university. You could use demand forecasting to predict increased demand for smaller units as students move out of their dorms.

This insight could lead to higher pricing for these units or targeting marketing campaigns to attract these customers early.

➡️ Inventory control

Source: Freepik

Inventory control involves managing the availability of your storage units to optimize occupancy rates and maximize revenue.

This process includes tracking unit availability, monitoring demand, adjusting pricing, and ensuring that different unit sizes and features are used to meet market trends and generate profit.

Additionally, inventory control involves quickly preparing recently vacated units for new customers to move into to maximize occupancy.

An example would be a self storage facility operator who notices that their ground-floor, climate-controlled units are consistently in high demand.

By closely monitoring occupancy rates, the operator could increase the rates for these units while offering discounts on second-floor, non-climate-controlled units to maintain revenue. They could also build more of these units to increase their profits.

➡️ Customer segmentation

Source: Freepik

Customer segmentation is when you divide your customer base into distinct groups based on customer behavior, needs, and demographics.

This segmentation allows self storage operators to tailor their pricing, marketing, and service strategies to maximize revenue, occupancy, and customer satisfaction.

For example, you could segment your customers into three groups: students, small business owners, and families. By addressing the specific needs of each group, you can improve occupancy and revenue.

💡 Balancing the Customer Experience with Revenue Management

While managing and optimizing your revenue as much as possible is important, it’s also essential to remember that your customers are at the center of your business. Their experience should be your priority, along with making a profit.

How to Optimize Your Revenue

Source: Freepik

Below are some strategies to help you optimize your self storage revenue:

💰 Review your pricing strategies
One of the most straightforward ways to optimize your revenue is to review your fee structure and determine where you could charge more.

An alternative to increasing your usual fees could be hiking up late fees, admin fees, or other secondary revenue generators.

You should regularly review your pricing to ensure that it reflects current market conditions, competitor pricing, and inflation.

💰 Consider rate increases
You may be worried that increasing your storage unit rates will cause tenants to move out. However, according to Amercian Realty Advisors, most customers will absorb multiple rate increases rather than move to another storage facility.

If you realistically assess what tenants can afford, consider your timing, and learn how to respond to tenants should they complain about an increase, you can charge more per unit and maximize your revenue.

A self storage facility, Placerville Self Storage, implemented several strategic initiatives over 18 months to optimize its revenue. One strategy was increasing its fees for both new and existing tenants.

This increased the facility’s revenue per occupied square foot from $0.75 to $0.99, marking a 32% rise.

💰 Get the right software
Over 91% of companies report achieving measurable value from their data analytics and software investments.

If you want to manage your revenue effectively, you need the right software. Self storage management software can automatically increase or decrease your prices based on any occupancy rules you set.

For example, when occupancy reaches 80%, you could increase your prices by 60%. Similarly, when occupancy rates fall below 60%, you can decrease your prices by 20%.

Your software can also apply and manage discounts on unit rentals on your storefront or allow you to use discounts as part of a targeted marketing campaign.

💰 Upsell to existing tenants
Upselling is a strategy in which you encourage your current tenants to purchase additional products, services, or upgrades, which increases their overall spending.

This approach optimizes your revenue without incurring the cost of acquiring new customers.

Upselling increases your revenue per tenant, provides cost efficiency, and maximizes facility usage.

For example, if a tenant’s unit is full, you could offer them a larger prorated unit or an additional unit at a discount. You could also suggest upgrading to a climate-controlled unit to protect their belongings from temperature and humidity fluctuations.

💰 Offer a range of products
Providing additional products and services to your customers, such as boxes, packing supplies, and truck rentals, can significantly enhance your revenue while improving the customer experience.

Selling these products and services diversifies your income beyond storage unit rentals and has higher margins, contributing directly to your bottom line.

It improves the customer experience by offering them convenience. Customers are also more likely to choose facilities that offer comprehensive solutions, giving you a competitive edge.

💰 Make buying insurance from you mandatory
Making tenant insurance mandatory for anyone who signs up for your self storage facilities benefits both your business and your tenants.

It provides financial protection and creates an additional revenue stream for you. It also ensures tenants' items are covered, reducing legal disputes or claims against your facility.

Offering insurance policies directly through your facility, often as a partner with an insurance provider, allows you to earn a commission or charge a markup, creating a steady additional revenue stream.

12 Tips for Effective Self Storage Marketing in 2025
By Gavin Shields on January 7, 2025
Self-storage-marketing.jpg
Companies that focus on nurturing leads through marketing make 50% more sales. If you’re not spending time marketing your self storage facility, you’re missing out on a massive opportunity to improve your occupancy and profitability.

The right self storage marketing strategy can be critical for effectively competing against other businesses in your local area.

However, finding the right marketing strategy for your self storage business can be challenging, especially for operators who are new to the sector. In fact, only 61% of marketers believe their strategy is effective.

To help, we’ve created this guide on 12 key areas you need to consider before implementing your self storage marketing strategy. The guide focuses on understanding and meeting the needs of your self storage customers.

Tip 1: Understand Your Audience
Self storage is a local business. Customers are always looking for convenient options nearby.

According to recent data, 40% of customers contact the first store they choose, whereas 53% of customers travel less than 15 minutes to their self storage unit.

That's why it's essential for your marketing efforts to focus on customers within your local area.

Focus on understanding market trends and consumer behavior to identify the best ways to capture your target audience’s attention and align your marketing strategies with what customers want.

To better understand your audience and keep your marketing strategies on track, we recommend that you:

➡️ Segment your audience
Over 58% of marketers find targeting and segmenting their audiences challenging.

Divide your target demographic into distinct segments based on factors like:

Age

Location

Specific storage needs

Income

Then, create detailed customer personas—incorporating interests, pain points, and goals—to humanise your audience and keep your marketing strategies agile as customer needs evolve.

➡️ Conduct market research
Nearly 80% of companies conduct market research on their performance, customers, industry, and competition.

Gather insights into your audience’s behaviours, preferences, and pain points through surveys, interviews, and data analysis.

One of the best ways to conduct market research is to hire a professional research company like MRFGR, which can arrange things like focus groups and fieldwork.

Understanding customer needs and motivations will enable you to craft marketing campaigns that resonate and drive impactful results.

➡️ Analyse competitor strategies
Over 90% of businesses say their industry has become more competitive in the last three years.

For this reason, you need to study your competitors’ marketing tactics and audience engagement strategies to identify gaps and opportunities within your target market.

Benchmarking your services against your competitors in the self storage industry can refine your approach and differentiate your business.

➡️ Utilise customer feedback
More than 90% of consumers believe companies should listen to their feedback to fuel innovation.

Leverage feedback from existing customers to gain valuable insights into their experiences, preferences, and pain points.

Actively seeking out and incorporating customer feedback into your marketing strategies demonstrates your commitment to customer satisfaction and helps keep your messaging relevant.

Tip 2: Optimize Your Website

Did you know that 94% of first impressions are based on your website? Your self storage website serves as your business's virtual storefront and your best chance of establishing immediate trust with potential customers.

Our team suggests placing a focus on:

➡️ Consider the user experience (UX)
Your website needs to provide a seamless user experience (UX). Start with a visually appealing design that reflects your brand identity and builds trust with visitors.

To create a polished look, use clean layouts, professional images, and consistent branding elements like your logo and colors.

Some other UX elements to focus on include:

👉 Effortless navigation: More than 88% of website users won’t return to a site if they encounter poor navigation. A well-organized and intuitive navigation menu can make a big difference. Ensure that users can easily find the information they’re looking for, such as how to book, unit sizes, pricing, and location details. As a rule of thumb, customers should be able to access what they need within three clicks.

👉 Mobile optimization: Over 90% of users access the internet via mobile devices, so your site must be mobile-responsive. This means pages should load quickly, and all features should work flawlessly on any device. Test your website across different screen sizes to ensure a consistent experience.

👉 Self-service features: Empower your customers by offering the option to book units directly from your website. An easy-to-use reservation system can help convert leads into customers instantly.

👉 Clear call to action (CTA) buttons: Guide users through your site with strategically placed CTA buttons. Phrases like “Reserve Your Unit Today,” “Check Availability,” or “Contact Us Now” should stand out visually and prompt immediate action.

👉 Streamlined content: Avoid overwhelming visitors with dense text. Instead, use concise messaging paired with bullet points or visuals to communicate key details effectively.

➡️ Showcase your value proposition
Differentiating your self storage business by highlighting its unique selling points is critical for your marketing efforts.

This process sets you apart from competitors. You might choose to focus on amenities, security features, and the convenience of your location.

Always prioritize using engaging visuals, such as professional photography and virtual tours, to showcase your facility and create an impression on visitors.

Below is an example of a good value proposition from Self Storage Plus that focuses on features and the customer experience:


Source

➡️ Ensure good website performance
Regularly monitor user behavior data and key performance metrics like website traffic, bounce rates, and conversion rates to identify areas for improvement across your website and enhance the user experience.

Page speed is an important aspect of your website's performance. Over 40% of consumers will abandon a website if it takes longer than three seconds to load. You can use the Google PageSpeed test to test your website's performance.

Get a High-Performance Website with Stora

Stora is a self storage facility management tool that offers the design of storage websites. Our websites are optimized for excellent performance, a great user experience, and to generate tons of conversions.

Tip 3: Leverage Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
Implementing search engine optimization (SEO) is essential for enhancing visibility and attracting potential customers online. Four out of five consumers conduct searches with local intent on search engines.

Prioritize SEO by conducting keyword research to identify terms and phrases related to self storage and the local area your target audience is searching for. A keyword is a term or phrase that people enter into search engines when they’re looking for something.

Add keywords to your website’s content, including your landing pages, blog articles, headings, and meta titles.

➡️ Focus on high-quality content
Search engine algorithms prioritize high-quality, relevant content that addresses the needs and questions of your target audience. By satisfying these criteria, you can organically improve your website’s ranking and visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs).

National Storage shares valuable, educational blog posts that address its target audience directly and answer their questions. They will rank for these keywords, which drives organic traffic and improves its overall ranking. It even provides a useful storage unit size guide to add extra value for their potential customers:

Tip 4: Focus on Local SEO and Your Google Business Profile

An important aspect of your SEO efforts is local search engine optimization. Over 98% of consumers use search engines to find local businesses, so local SEO, like having a Google Business profile (previously known as Google My Business), is essential to boost your online visibility.

Here are some key local marketing strategies to consider:

➡️ Claim and update your Google Business Profile listing
After claiming and verifying your Google Business Profile, ensure the listing is accurate and consistent with other online platforms.

This includes updating business information like name, address, phone number (NAP), business hours, and photos associated with the profile.

To entice potential customers, enrich your profile with high-quality photos showcasing your facility and its amenities.

Below is a good example of a Google Business Profile from Store-n-Lock Self Storage. The profile includes all their business information as well as high-quality images of their facility:


➡️ Encourage customer reviews and engagement
Over 99% of customers read reviews when searching for something online. This is why you should actively encourage satisfied customers to leave positive reviews on your Google Business Profile.

This will help encourage local word of mouth, support professional referrals, and enhance your business's credibility.

Below are some of Public Storage’s Google Business Profile reviews, giving them credibility and helping to build their brand:


➡️ Focus on local keywords and location-based content
Where possible, incorporate local keywords and phrases relevant into your website content.

If you’re targeting multiple locations, consider creating location-specific landing pages or blog posts to address customers' unique needs and interests in each area you serve.

➡️ Optimize for Google Maps

Tip 5: Effective Paid Advertising
Paid advertising tactics like Google Ads have an average return on investment (ROI) of $2 for every $1 spent. This makes paid advertising a great option for marketing your self storage business.

Paid advertising involves paying for ad placements on platforms like Google, social media, or other websites to promote your storage facility.

This could include search engine ads that appear when potential customers search for storage solutions.

Pay-per-click (PPC) advertising on Google allows you to pay for your business to appear at the top of search results when users look for something online, as you can see below:


Paid ads also include display ads, which appear on various websites or social media, targeting specific demographics.

The goal is to increase visibility, attract more customers, and drive conversions—such as unit bookings or inquiries—by reaching people actively seeking self storage.

When developing your paid ads, you should do the following:

➡️ Craft engaging ads
Create attention-grabbing ad copy and visuals highlighting your self storage facility's unique selling points and benefits.

Use persuasive language and compelling imagery to entice users to click on your ads and learn more about your offerings.

Here are some examples of engaging self storage Facebook ads from ClickStorage:


Source

➡️ Set realistic budgets and targeting options
Determine your marketing budget based on your business goals and allocate funds strategically across different campaigns and ad platforms.

Use targeting options to reach your ideal audience effectively, including their:

🎯 Geographic location.

🎯 Demographic characteristics, like age, income, and household size.

🎯 Interests, such as moving, home organization, or decluttering.

🎯 Online behaviors, including searching for storage solutions or engaging with related content.

➡️ Experiment with ad formats
Experiment with different ad formats, placements, and messaging to identify which combinations resonate best with your target audience.

Test variations of ad headlines, descriptions, and calls to action to optimize campaign performance and maximize ROI.

➡️ Use ads to build brand awareness
By focusing your advertising efforts on location-specific keywords and featuring your brand name front and center, you can build brand awareness and increase the likelihood of conversions from those already familiar with it.

➡️ Monitor and optimize ad performance
Monitor key performance metrics like click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate, and cost-per-acquisition (CPA) regularly to gauge the effectiveness of your paid advertising campaigns. Use this data to identify underperforming ads and make adjustments accordingly.

Tip 6: Content Marketing
Quality content is king. The right approach to content can attract and retain customers while building credibility and authority for your business. Over 80% of marketers say that content marketing has helped them to build brand awareness and grow loyalty.

To create the right content marketing strategy, you should:

➡️ Develop a content calendar and plan
Create a content calendar outlining the topics, formats, and publishing schedule for your content. This ensures a consistent flow of relevant content that engages your audience throughout their decision-making process.

➡️ Provide valuable and informative content
Focus on creating high-quality, informative content that educates and empowers your audience.

Offer tips, insights, and practical advice related to self storage solutions, moving tips, organization hacks, and decluttering strategies to position your brand as a trusted voice in the industry.

ExtraSpace Storage offers informative, high-quality content on their blog to educate their audience and improve their search engine rankings:

➡️ Diversify your content formats and channels
To appeal to different audience preferences and habits, experiment with various content formats, such as blog posts, videos, and infographics.

➡️ Partner with influencers
Engage with local influencers or micro-influencers who resonate with your target demographic to share authentic endorsements and recommendations for your self storage services.

Storage Sense and Valley Storage recently partnered with two niche social media influencers to promote their facilities. This initiative led to more than a dozen new rentals for each new facility.

➡️ Measure and analyze content performance
Track key performance metrics, such as website traffic, engagement metrics, and lead generation, to evaluate the effectiveness of your content marketing efforts.

Use analytics tools to identify top-performing content, understand audience behavior, and make data-driven decisions to optimize your content strategy for better results.

Tip 7: Leverage Social Media
Over 75% of consumers want brands to use social media to connect with them. Additionally, 71% of users are more likely to make a purchase if they’re referred by social media.

The benefits of social media are clear. What’s less clear is how new or growing businesses can maximize their presence on these platforms.

So, aside from leveraging paid advertising and integrating content creation strategies, how can you get more from social media for your self storage business?

To identify the right social media strategy for your self storage business, we suggest:

➡️ Choose the right platforms
Identify the social media platforms where your target audience is most present and active.

For example, 22% of 40 to 49-year-olds use Facebook, and 32% of 30 to 39-year-olds use Instagram.

To start, we suggest focusing your efforts on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), and LinkedIn.

➡️ Engage with your audience
Promote more meaningful interactions with your audience by promptly responding to comments and messages and hosting contests and Q&A sessions to build a sense of community among your followers.

Additionally, encourage user-generated content (UGC) by sharing genuine customer testimonials and reviews.

➡️ Monitor competitor activity
Keep an eye on your competitors' social media activity. Pay attention to the types of content they share, the engagement they receive, and the promotions they run.

This information can help you refine your own social media strategy and develop more effective promotions.

➡️ Consistently carry out social listening exercises
Social listening exercises can be a great way to track mentions of your brand across various online platforms, including social media channels, review websites, and forums.

This will not only help you find out where your customers are, but it also acts as a direct line to your customers’ needs.

➡️ Tell people how to book units
Use your social media platforms to inform potential customers how to reserve or book a storage unit at your facility. You could do this by sharing a link to your bookings section on your website.

➡️ Share photos of your facility
Social media is all about visuals, so ensure you share high-quality images of your storage facility on your platforms to attract potential customers.

The social media posts below from Cubesmart as part of their Made to Keep campaign include a high-quality image of their facility and a short and engaging description:

➡️ Post about community involvement
If your business is participating in community events or has formed partnerships with local businesses, be sure to post about this on your social media platforms for additional exposure.

Tip 8: Encourage Customer Reviews and Testimonials

More than 75% of consumers trust online reviews. Positive or negative, customer reviews can have a huge impact—especially in an industry like storage, where trust, security, and convenience are essential.

How you approach customer relationship management will directly impact your online reviews.

To encourage positive reviews and manage your online reputation more effectively, we recommend:

➡️ Create a feedback loop
A feedback loop is a systematic approach to gathering and responding to customer feedback.

By establishing a structured process, you can make it easier for customers to share their thoughts, whether it’s about their overall experience, the condition of their storage unit, or any other aspect of your self storage facility.

➡️ Establish multiple feedback channels
Offer customers various ways to provide feedback. These can include everything from online surveys and social media conversations to direct feedback via email or phone.

By providing multiple avenues for feedback, you increase the likelihood of receiving more insights from a broader range of customers.

➡️ Incentivise reviews
Offer incentives like discounts, freebies, or loyalty rewards to customers who leave positive reviews or refer new customers to your business.

Just be sure to comply with platform guidelines and regulations regarding incentivized reviews.

➡️ Showcase testimonials in marketing materials
In your marketing materials, website, and social media channels, feature positive reviews, testimonials, and success stories from satisfied customers.

Use authentic, relatable testimonials to build trust and credibility with potential customers and showcase the value of your self storage services.

➡️ Contact those who leave you negative reviews
Ignoring negative reviews won’t get rid of them. Instead, you should respond to negative reviews and address customer complaints. You can use this as an opportunity to learn from your customers and improve your business.

➡️ Run a contest
This is an effective way to market your business with help from your current customers. Run a simple contest on your social media platforms asking for customer reviews in exchange for a prize.

You can also ask your customers to share photos as entries into your contest, which will give you additional content to share on your marketing channels.

➡️ Include a name and picture
Doing this is a great way to give credibility to customer reviews and thank them for posting them.

Consider adding the source of the review, such as Yelp, to encourage other customers to give you their feedback.

💡 Ask Customers to Share Their Experience

If you’re confident that your self storage facility offers an exceptional customer experience, it’s always worth asking customers to share their experiences with you and on public channels.

Consider sending follow-up emails after a customer moves out as part of your feedback loop.

You can also provide links to review platforms, short surveys, or instant rating windows for convenience.

With a more personalized approach, you can maintain good customer relationships and gather valuable insights to improve your self storage services.

➡️ Implement changes based on feedback
Use the insights gained from customer feedback to implement company-wide changes to your facilities, services, or policies as needed.

Continuously monitor the impact of these changes and seek further feedback to ensure their effectiveness and customer satisfaction.

Tip 9: Email Marketing
The average ROI for email marketing is between $36 and $40 for every dollar spent, making it a worthwhile investment for your business.

Email marketing remains a highly effective tool for nurturing customer relationships, driving conversions, and encouraging repeat business.

To create an effective email marketing strategy, we suggest:

➡️ Create an email list
The first step is building a targeted email list. Start by collecting email addresses from customers who have inquired about your services, signed up for newsletters, or used your facility in the past.

Another way to find email addresses is to use tools like hunter.io, which gives you access to contact details in seconds.

You can also gather addresses through your website, social media channels, and promotions.

➡️ Write a good subject line
Your subject line is the first thing your subscribers see, so it needs to be compelling. A good subject line grabs attention, creates curiosity, and entices the reader to open the email. Keep it short, clear, and relevant.

Examples of good subject lines include:

💬 Need More Space? We’ve Got You Covered

💬 Unlock Your Storage Solution Today—Special Offer Inside

💬 Time to Clear Out? Get [X% off] Your First Month

💬 Moving? Here’s a Storage Deal You Can’t Miss

💬 Safe, Secure, and Affordable Storage—Reserve Yours Now

➡️ Create a compelling email
Once you’ve got their attention, keep the email content engaging. Be concise, informative, and friendly while focusing on the value your facility offers. We recommend keeping the message to around 150 words and definitely no more than 250 words.

You can highlight promotions, seasonal offers, or tips for using self storage efficiently.

➡️ Avoid spam filters
To ensure your emails reach inboxes and not spam folders, avoid using excessive capital letters, multiple exclamation marks, or words commonly associated with spam, such as “free” or “urgent.”

➡️ Use automation
Consider using software like Mailchimp, Constant Contact, or HubSpot to streamline your email marketing.

These tools allow you to automate your campaigns, segment your email list, and personalize messages based on customer behavior or demographics.

Automation can save you time and ensure you send the right message to the right people.

➡️ Focus on personalization
Tailor your email content to specific audience segments based on their preferences, behavior, and past interactions with your business.

Use these personalized recommendations to deliver relevant, engaging messages that resonate with each recipient.

➡️ Send personalized communications
Personalized emails achieve an excellent open rate of 29% and a CTR of 41%.

Use your customer relationship management (CRM) data to send personalized communications to current and past customers.

Segment specific parts of your audience based on their preferences, behavior, and past interactions with your business.

Consider sending reminders, customer anniversary messages, or special offers tailored to their storage needs. Personalized emails can make customers feel valued and appreciated.

➡️ Automate your workflows
Implement automated email workflows to streamline your communication processes and deliver timely, targeted messages to subscribers at different stages of the customer journey.

For example, consider setting up automated welcome emails, abandoned cart reminders, follow-up sequences, and re-engagement campaigns to nurture leads and drive conversions.

➡️ Optimize for mobile
More than 41% of emails are viewed on mobile devices, so ensure your email campaigns are optimized for mobile responsiveness.

Make sure your emails read well across all screen sizes and devices and provide a seamless user experience for mobile users.

➡️ Monitor results
After sending out your emails, it’s important to track their performance. Use the analytics your email marketing software provides to monitor open rates, click-through rates, and conversion rates.

This data will help you refine your strategy and optimize future campaigns, ensuring you get the most out of your email marketing efforts.

Tip 10: Partnerships and Networking
Partnering with local businesses, communities, and organizations opens up new opportunities for your self storage business. Networking in the ever-changing storage industry keeps you informed on trends, growth, and competition.

To boost your authority and strengthen your local presence, consider:

➡️ Be strategic about potential partners
Identify local businesses and organizations that align with your self storage mission and target audience. Look for collaboration opportunities with moving companies, real estate agencies, home staging pros, and community groups to ensure meaningful partnerships.

Lock+Store partnered with a moving company called Packers Xpress to streamline the moving process for their customers. They sent out a press release regarding their collaboration and received some impressive press coverage as a result:

➡️ Attend networking events
Attend local networking events, industry conferences, and expos to connect with professionals in your area. Networking helps build relationships, spark ideas, and uncover long-term partnership opportunities for your self storage business.

➡️ Get involved in the community
To demonstrate your commitment to the local community, sponsor events, support charitable causes, or participate in community initiatives.

Sponsoring sports teams has become a popular strategy for many self storage operators.

Building a positive reputation and establishing goodwill within the community can help attract new customers, connect with potential employees, and strengthen your brand presence.

➡️ Establish a referral program
Implement a referral program that incentivizes existing customers and partners to refer new clients to your self storage facility.

To encourage word-of-mouth marketing, offer rewards such as discounts on storage space rentals, gift cards, or free storage upgrades for successful referrals.

Tip 11: Experiment with Offline Marketing
Offline marketing can still be a valuable tool for reaching local audiences. Here's how to harness the power of print advertising to promote your self storage business:

➡️ Advertise in local publications
Consider advertising in local newspapers, magazines, and community newsletters to target residents in your area.

These publications often have loyal readerships and can provide a cost-effective way to reach potential customers needing storage solutions.

➡️ Consider direct mail campaigns
Did you know that direct mail response rates are five to nine times higher than any other advertising channel?

Try direct mail campaigns, such as sending flyers, leaflets, or mailers to target specific neighborhoods or demographics with promotional offers and information about your self storage facility.

Use eye-catching designs that highlight your key selling points and provide a compelling call to action to encourage recipients to inquire about your services.

➡️ Use billboards and outdoor signage
Invest in billboards or outdoor signage strategically placed near high-traffic areas like busy roads or shopping centers. Billboards drive an ROI of 38%.

Use bold graphics, concise messaging, and your facility's location to attract attention and drive awareness.

Tip 12: Analyze and Improve
Effective marketing requires continuous monitoring and optimization based on data-driven insights.

As your business grows (and algorithms change!), you need to be able to adapt your strategies accordingly.

Here are some key steps to consider:

➡️ Set clear goals and key performance indicators (KPIs)
Define specific, measurable goals for your marketing campaigns, like increasing website traffic, generating leads, or boosting conversion rates.

Then, identify the KPIs that align with these goals and use them to track progress and measure success.

➡️ Monitor customer feedback
As good as analytics tools are, it’s still important to remember that customer feedback never lies.

So, pay close attention to customer feedback, reviews, and comments across various channels to identify areas for improvement and address any issues or concerns customers raise.

➡️ Regularly review and adjust strategies
Continuously monitor and evaluate your marketing performance against your goals and KPIs. Identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for optimization and make data-driven decisions based on this information.

Indoor Self Storage vs. Outdoor Container Storage: Weighing the Pros and Cons
As a self-storage owner or investor, the decision to build either an indoor self-storage facility or an outdoor container storage facility is an important decision. Each option comes with its unique advantages and challenges, making it essential to carefully evaluate various factors before making a well-informed choice.

Indoor Self Storage Facility:
Pros
Premium Pricing:
Indoor self-storage facilities often command higher rental rates due to the added benefits they offer, such as climate-controlled units, enhanced security or better unit ventilation. As a result, you can potentially achieve higher revenue per square foot compared to outdoor container storage. My own indoor facility achieves around £21 per square foot versus a nearby container site at £10.

Long-Term Value:
Investing in an indoor facility demonstrates a commitment to providing a higher level of service and security to customers. This can lead to greater brand loyalty, attracting long-term tenants who value the premium features and are willing to pay a premium price. Indoor self storage facilities also typically sell at much higher multiples if and when you go to sell. Plus, there is a well defined market for the buying or selling of indoor sites.

Upselling Opportunities:
The (usually) higher quality environment of indoor storage enables you to target a broader range of customers, including those seeking to store sensitive or valuable items. Additionally, you can offer ancillary services, such as packing supplies or document shredding, to increase your revenue streams.

Increased Security Measures:
Indoor facilities allow for better control over security, with options for advanced surveillance systems, access control, and onsite personnel. This heightened security not only protects customers' belongings but also instills confidence in potential tenants.

Cons
High Initial Investment:
Building an indoor self-storage facility demands a more substantial initial investment due to the need for climate control systems, partitioning, and advanced security infrastructure. This could impact the project's overall return on investment in the short term. When I started StoreStuff, I took out a 20 year lease on a relatively small warehouse to keep up-front costs down. I also phased the fit out (49 units on Day 1, another 40 after 9 months and the remainder 6 months later), keeping the initial costs down.

Operating Costs:
Business rates, rent (if applicable), as well as maintenance, cleaning and security costs can lead to higher ongoing operating costs. As an owner, you must carefully balance these expenses against the premium rental rates charged to customers.

Outdoor Container Storage:
Pros
Lower Construction Costs:
Developing an outdoor container storage facility typically requires fewer capital expenditures than an indoor facility. This cost-effectiveness can lead to quicker returns on investment and lower financial risks.

Versatility and Scalability:
Outdoor storage facilities offer greater flexibility in expanding storage capacity by adding more containers as demand increases. This scalability allows you to respond to market demands efficiently.

Reduced Maintenance:
Outdoor storage containers are generally low-maintenance, as they are built to withstand various weather conditions. This can lead to lower ongoing operational expenses.

Cons
Revenue Potential:
Outdoor container storage tends to command lower rental rates compared to indoor self-storage. The lack of climate control and limited amenities may deter some potential customers who prefer premium features. Some containers can have issues with damp and condensation and though steps can be taken to prevent this, customer’s may be less willing to pay higher prices due to concerns.

Security Concerns:
While basic security measures can be implemented, outdoor facilities may be perceived as less secure by potential tenants. Investing in comprehensive security solutions is essential to instil confidence in customers.

Weather-Related Risks:
Outdoor storage exposes customers' belongings to the elements more than indoor, which may lead to weather-related damage or deterioration of certain items over time.

Long-Term Value:
Although cash flow can be very strong from an outdoor container facility (which, for most investors is all that matters), if you are looking to sell it may well be more difficult to sell than an indoor facility. There have been less transactions in the UK for outdoor facilities and I suspect the multiples would likely be much lower.

Conclusion
There is no right or wrong choice here. Whatever you decide might well be based on how much you have to invest, whether or not you already own land or a warehouse, or what you think might work better in your local market. Either way, we have seen many successful businesses being built with both approaches.

UK Self Storage Business Tools & Services Ecosystem
UK Self Storage Business Tools & Services Ecosystem
Welcome to the Stora UK Self Storage Ecosystem: your one-stop knowledge base for everything self storage.

Interest in the world of self storage is exploding right now. Savvy people worldwide have realized that it's a great business to be in. Once set up, it offers high returns with low effort.

There's also a big unmet supply need, and that's why we're seeing the industry performing better than ever. Check out the latest UK Self Storage Annual Report, or our own UK Self Storage Industry Insights Report showing the phenomenal growth over the last year.

In the past, much of the work in a self storage business was upfront—selling (both digitally and in person), setting payments platform, access systems, insurance—and so much more. But now there are tools to help, and we've brought them together for you—to save you hours of painful searching and trial and error.

You can find them all here in the UK Self Storage Business Tools & Services Ecosystem.

At Stora, we've compiled them all into an easy-to-use graphic that gives you a visual overview, and lists each resource below out, so you can learn more.

We'll keep updating this on a regular basis as new resources launch, and as we become aware of them.

This is by no means an exhaustive list, but with more than 60 companies represented, it does paint a good picture of the Business Tools Ecosystem.

If you are aware of something you think should be included, please let us know.

🏪 Indoor facility fit-out (7)
Indoor facilities are a great way to provide your customers with a secure, climate-controlled storage solution. There are a number of providers who operate within the UK.

🛗 Mezzanines & elevators (8)
If you've decided on an indoor facility, it's likely you'll be asking yourself if you should offer storage across multiple floors. If you decide on a mezzanine, you'll be required to provide an elevator too. Here are a few options to consider:

Janus, Active Supply & Design, Storage Future - Mezzanines, elevators and facility fit-out
CSC Industries, United Storage, SAS Storage, Kuboid - Mezzanines and facility fit-out

Automated smart entry systems have opened up an entirely new way to offer self storage.

Instead, they empower your customers to access their unit and belongings at a time that suits them best. Here are the best options available in the UK today:

Nokē - A fully keyless entry system allowing your customers to access your facility via a smartphone app

☂️ Insurance (6)
In the UK, it is required that your customers have insurance during their stay with you. Selling insurance through your business is a great way to increase your revenue. Here are a few of the most popular providers who you use to sell insurance onto your customers:

Basil Fry, Gallagher, Pound Gates, Reason Global, Insurastore, Surewise
🔒 Packaging & padlocks (6)
Another popular way to increase self storage sales is to sell packaging, boxes, and padlocks—all the things people really need when they are interested in storage. If you'd like to offer these items at your facility, here are a few of the main UK providers:

PHS Teacrate, Packing Boxes, Packaging Express, DavPack - Packaging
Nothing But Padlocks, Locks Direct - Padlocks
📍 Local Suppliers
Other provisions may need to be made, which will likely require local services after your fit out. This list is not exhaustive, but could include:

Gate installation - Sign companies - Provision for main signage and potentially instructional signs for the facility.
Planning & building control consultants - Will be required for building, remodelling or repurposing. Local restrictions and rules will apply.
Maintenance & cleaning services - Keep your facility looking its best by ensuring all areas are clean, and maintenance issues are fixed quickly.
Fire safety consultants - Documented fire plan and provisions.
Pest consultants - Useful to keep any pest issues minimized.
Sign companies - Provision for main signage and potentially instructional signs for the facility.
Local advertising services - Use of local services like newspapers, mail drops alongside internet based services can be useful.
Finance and accounting services - Services may be required to manage the accounting, bookkeeping and payroll side.
For these, we recommend you get a referral from someone local to your facility location. Failing that, try Googling for "Your town/area name + what you need". Check reviews on Google, Facebook and elsewhere to get a better understanding of the quality of their service.

What does the next 10 years look like for self storage business tools and services?
We're building Stora to be the operating system that centralizes everything, and makes your life as a self storage operator as easy as possible.
