        <h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>
        <p className="lead">Last updated: January 2025</p>

        <h2>Our Commitment to Transparency</h2>
        <p>
          We believe in complete transparency regarding our business model. This
          disclosure explains how we make money through affiliate partnerships while
          maintaining our commitment to providing honest, unbiased information to our
          visitors.
        </p>

        <h2>How We Make Money</h2>
        <p>
          This website contains affiliate links. This means that if you click on
          certain links on our website and subsequently make a purchase, we may
          receive a commission. These commissions help us maintain and improve our
          services while keeping them free for our users.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Review Process</h2>
        <p>
          We maintain editorial independence in our review process. Our
          recommendations are based on thorough research, testing, and analysis of
          each product. The presence or absence of an affiliate relationship never
          influences our reviews or recommendations.
        </p>

        <h2>Affiliate Partnerships</h2>
        <p>
          We partner with leading self-storage software and service providers. All
          partnerships are carefully selected based on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Product quality and reliability</li>
          <li>Company reputation</li>
          <li>Customer service standards</li>
          <li>Value for money</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Trust Matters</h2>
        <p>
          We value your trust above all else. While we may receive compensation
          through affiliate partnerships, we always strive to provide accurate,
          honest, and helpful information to our readers.
        </p>

        <h2>Questions?</h2>
